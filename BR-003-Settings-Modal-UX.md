# Bug Report – BR-003

## Title
Settings modal blocks UI and cannot be repositioned or resized

---

## Environment
- Platform: Web Application
- Browser: Chrome (latest)
- OS: Windows 11
- Account Type: Standard User

---

## Severity
Minor (UX / Accessibility impact)

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in as a user.
2. Open "Settings" from the left navigation panel.
3. Attempt to reposition or resize the Settings modal window.

---

## Expected Result
The Settings modal should allow repositioning or resizing, or clearly communicate that it is intentionally fixed.

---

## Actual Result
The modal is fixed in position and size without any visible indication. It blocks interaction with underlying UI elements and cannot be adjusted.

---

## Impact
This behavior may negatively affect usability, especially for users working with multiple windows or smaller screen resolutions.

---

## Notes
The issue appears to be a UX design constraint rather than a system failure. However, the lack of flexibility or visual feedback may reduce accessibility and workflow comfort.
